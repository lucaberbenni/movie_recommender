This project implements a movie recommender system using machine learning algorithms. The recommender system suggests movies to users based on their ratings or preferences. The application is built using Python and Flask framework.

### Files

The project consists of the following files:

1. `app.py`: This is the main Python script that sets up the Flask web application and defines the routes for handling user requests. It utilizes the `Recommender` class to generate movie recommendations based on user input.

2. `recommender.py`: This file contains the `Recommender` class, which encapsulates the logic for the movie recommender system. It uses the `pandas` and `scikit-learn` libraries for data manipulation and machine learning algorithms. The class provides methods for data preprocessing, matrix factorization, cosine similarity, and generating movie recommendations.

3. `templates/home.html`: This HTML template is rendered when the user visits the homepage (`/`). It displays a list of random movies to the user.

4. `templates/results.html`: This HTML template is rendered when the user submits a form with movie ratings. It shows the movie recommendations generated by the movie recommender system based on the user's input. It also displays another set of random movies.

5. `templates/random.html`: This HTML template is rendered when the user clicks on the "ðŸŽ²" button. It displays a set of random movie recommendations to the user.

6. `templates/cosine_results.html`: This HTML template is rendered when the user submits a form with movie ratings. It shows the movie recommendations generated by the movie recommender system based on cosine similarity. It also displays another set of random movies.

7. `static/stylesheet.css`: This CSS file contains the styling rules for the HTML templates.

8. `data/movies.csv`: This CSV file contains the movie data, including the movie titles and their corresponding IDs.

9. `data/ratings.csv`: This CSV file contains the user ratings for the movies, including the user IDs, movie IDs, and ratings.

### Usage

To use the movie recommender system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the required dependencies are installed (Pandas, Flask, NumPy, Sci-kit Learn).

2. Run the Flask application by executing the command `python app.py`. The application will start running on `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Access the application through a web browser by visiting `http://localhost:5000`. You will see a list of random movies on the homepage.

4. On the homepage, you can click on the "ðŸŽ²" button to get a set of random movie recommendations. You can also submit a form with your movie ratings to receive personalized movie recommendations based on the NMF algorithm or cosine similarity.

5. Explore the different routes (`/results` and `/cosine_results`) to see different sets of movie recommendations based on your input.

### About

This movie recommender system project demonstrates the implementation of machine learning algorithms for personalized movie recommendations. It showcases the use of Flask framework for building a web application and provides an interactive user interface for exploring movie suggestions. The project can be further extended to incorporate additional features and algorithms for enhanced recommendations.
